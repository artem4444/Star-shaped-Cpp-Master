# Star-shaped-Cpp-Master

star-shaped cpp data collecting and organizing: assume data is from stm32 slaves and is already processed by a hardware interface; use gtest to simulated that data; code cpp class that will retrieve context from data and assign it to a struct

### supposed:
- timing is controlled by calling function



# GTest
- generate mock vectors-buffers comming from hardware_interface reading data from slaves via kernel
-
